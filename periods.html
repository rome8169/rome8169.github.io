  <b>Title: </b>The Betti side of double shuffle relations<br>
  <b>Speaker: </b>Prof. Hidekazu Furusho (Nagoya University)<br>
  <b>Time: </b>Fri., 9:30-10:30 am, Oct. 25, 2024<br>
  <b>Venue: </b>C654, Shuangqing Complex Building A<br>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract: </b><br>
  This lecture presents joint work with Enriquez, addressing the Betti side of Racinet's study on double shuffle relations for multiple zeta values. While Racinet's work primarily focused on the 'de Rham side', our research develops the previously unexplored 'Betti side' of the theory. We will introduce the construction of the Betti counterpart to the double shuffle group, demonstrating how this complements and extends Racinet's original framework. The key contribution of our work lies in revealing  the "stabilizer interpretation" of the double shuffle group.<br>

  <b>Title: </b>Algebraic formulae for differential equations of polylogarithms: genus 0, 1, and beyond?<br>
  <b>Speaker: </b>Prof. Tiago J. Fonseca (IMECC - Unicamp)<br>
  <b>Time: </b>Fri., 8:00-9:00 am, June 14, 2024<br>
  <b>Venue: </b>Zoom Meeting ID: 271 534 5558 Passcode: YMSC<br>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract: </b><br>
  The classical (multiple) polylogarithm functions play, through their special values, a prominent role in a number of arithmetic questions related to periods and motives. Crucially, these functions satisfy an algebraic differential equation, the KZ equation, from which many of their properties are derived. In particular, they can be written as iterated integrals of certain algebraic differential forms with logarithmic singularities on the complex projective line. One may ask what can be said for higher genus curves.<br>
  <br>
  In this talk, I will survey some of the classical genus 0 theory and discuss joint work with Nils Matthes one the genus 1 case. We describe explicit algebraic formulae for the analogue of the KZ equation in the genus 1 case, the so-called elliptic KZB equation, relying on algebro-geometric properties of universal vector extensions of elliptic curves. If time permits, I will also speculate on a possible direction to approach the higher genus case.<br>

  <b>Title: </b>Differential equations, hypergeometric families, and Beilinson's conjectures<br>
  <b>Speaker: </b>Prof. Matt Kerr（Washington University in St. Louis）<br>
  <b>Time: </b>Tues., 9:00-10:00 am, May 28, 2024<br>
  <b>Venue: </b>Zoom Meeting ID: 687 513 9542 Passcode: YMSC<br>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract: </b><br>
  We discuss two approaches to solving inhomogeneous equations of the form L(.)=t^{1/d}, where L is a hypergeometric differential operator attached to a family of CY varieties.  The first is by elementary complex analysis, using so-called Frobenius deformations, and gives an explicit series solution.  The second is via normal functions attached to algebraic cycles (both "classical" and "higher") on a base-change of the family.  <br>
  I will briefly review regulator maps, their relation to inhomogeneous Picard-Fuchs equations, and the relevant cases of the Beilinson conjecture.  Turning then to the CY3 examples classified by Doran-Morgan, I will explain how to identify which types of cycles arise (viz., K_0, K_2, or K_4 classes), and how to use the Frobenius deformations to make the conjecture more explicit.  This is joint work with Vasily Golyshev. <br>

  <b>Title: </b>Rational K\pi 1 property for Reimann surfaces<br>
  <b>Speaker: </b>Prof. Tomohide Terasoma（Hosei University）<br>
  <b>Time: </b>Fri., 9:00-10:00 am, May 10, 2024<br>
  <b>Venue: </b>Online Zoom Meeting ID: 4552601552 Passcode: YMSC<br>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract: </b><br>
  In the study of mixed elliptic motives, we noticed the importance for rational K\pi 1 property on some bar complex arising from mixed elliptic motives. Since its bar complex is some what complicated, it will be useful to consider some easier case, the case for Riemann surfaces.<br>
Rational fundamental group of Riemann surface is desribed by Sullivan's old paper, but it seems that rational K\pi 1 property seems to be not well discussed. As for arrangements of hyperplanes, several technic and results are know by several person, including the case for supersolvable case,etc.<br>
In our talk, we consider some technic to show the rational K\pi 1 property for Riemann surfaces, which might be applicable to mixed elliptic motives.<br>

  <b>Title: </b>Techniques to move algebraic cycles, old and new<br>
  <b>Speaker: </b>Wataru Kai（Tohoku University）<br>
  <b>Time: </b>Thur., 15:00-16:00, April 25, 2024<br>
  <b>Venue: </b>Online Zoom Meeting ID: 4552601552 Passcode: YMSC<br>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract: </b><br>
  Moving lemmas are statements about how to move given closed subsets of varieties into generic, well-behaved positions. They are often technical keys to important results on algebraic cycles and cohomology theories. I will review some historically significant moving lemmas and mention a few that I have proven in recent years.<br>
